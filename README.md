# cipher-string-project
A Python project on string manipulation using ciphers- built via freecodecamp.
# 🔐 Cipher String Manipulation – Python Project

This is a mini Python project I built while learning on [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/). It demonstrates how to manipulate strings by creating a simple cipher to encrypt and decrypt text based on a custom key.

## 🚀 Features
- Encrypts a message using a basic cipher technique
- Decrypts the message using the same key
- Shows use of string slicing, loops, and custom functions

## 🧠 What I Learned
- String manipulation in Python
- Writing and using functions
- Debugging and testing code
- Basic logic for encryption/decryption

## 📂 Files
- `cypher.py`: Main Python script that handles the logic

## 🛠️ How to Run
1. Make sure Python is installed on your system
2. Open terminal or command prompt
3. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python cypher.py

  📝 Sample Output
Encrypted text: mrttaqrhknsw ih puggrur  
Decrypted text: freecodecamp is awesome  
Key: happycoding
